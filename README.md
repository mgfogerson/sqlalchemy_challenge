# sqlalchemy_hw

For this homework, I first created a Jupyter notebook that broke down the precipitation values for the last year of a series of Hawaii weather station measurements. To do so, I used sqlalchemy in a Jupyter notebook to read, join and parse sqlite databases for both station names and individual measurements/dates. After finishing the notebook, I created a Python app that will read the files and output specified information in a JSON format, including a dictionary of dates (key) and precipitation, a listing of all the station ID's available in the list, and the minimum, maximum and average temps of a time range. The time range can be either after a start point or between a start and end point.
